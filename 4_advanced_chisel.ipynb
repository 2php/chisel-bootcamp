    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Chisel is a framework that helps users write hardware generators.\n",
    "The idea is to encode a designer's methodology into a program that can be used to create many categories of a circuit.\n",
    "Some generators are very narrow in scope and can be used to generate a small set of designs, for example an adder parameterized by the width of its operands.\n",
    "Other generators are very broad in scope and can generate circuits with a wide range of architectures, for example a rocket core that can either be in-order or out-of-order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the popular HDLs have some mechanisms for writing generators, but they are often difficult to use to write sophisticated generators because of limitations of the language.\n",
    "Chisel can make writing sophisticated generators much easier because it is hosted in Scala.\n",
    "This allows generator writers to use the powerful language features of Scala and the software development practices they enable that are not possible in HDLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Writing parameterized modules\n",
    "  - Writing parameterized IOs, and advanced IO for generators\n",
    "  - Miscellaneous useful things like multiple clock domains, verilog blackboxing, and more"
