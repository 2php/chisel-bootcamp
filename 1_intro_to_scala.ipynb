    "\n",
    "- It is a good language for hosting an embedded DSL.\n",
    "- It has a powerful and elegant library for manipulating various collections of data.\n",
    "- It has a rigorous type system that helps catch a large class of errors very early in the development cycle.\n",

    "Code blocks are delimited by braces.  A block can contain zero or more lines of Scala code. The last line of Scala code becomes the return value (which may be ignored) of the code block.  A code block with no lines would return and special null-like object called `Unit`. Code blocks are used throughout Scala: they are the bodies of class definitions, they form function and method definitions, they are the clauses of `if` statements, and they are the bodies of `for` and many other Scala operators.\n",

You might see this written in many different ways. This type of code block is called an anonymous function, and more details on anonymous functions are provided in a later module."
