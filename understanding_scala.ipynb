    "* ```class WrapCounter```: This is the definition of **WrapCounter**\n",
    "* ```(counterBits: Int)```: Creating MyCounter requires an integer argument, nicely named to suggest it is the bit width of the counter\n",
    "* braces ({}) delimit a block of code. Most classes use a code block to define variables and constants and methods (functions)\n",
    "* ```val max: Long =``` the class contains a member variable **max**, declared as ```Long``` and initialized as the class is created\n",
    "* ```(1 << counterBits) - 1``` computes the maximum value that can be contained in **counterBits** bits.  Since **max** was created with _val_ it cannot be changed.\n",
    "* a variable **counter** is created and initialized to **0L**, the **L** says that 0 is a long value and from this **counter** is inferred to be Long.\n",
    "* **max** and **counter** are commonly called _member variables_ of the class\n",
    "* a class method **inc** is defined which takes no arguments and returns a **Long** value\n",
    "* the body of the method **inc** is a code block that:\n",
    "  * ```counter = counter + 1``` increments **counter**\n",
    "  * ```if(counter > max) counter = 0``` tests if it is greater than the **max** value and sets it back to zero if it is\n",
    "  * ```counter``` the last line of the code block is important\n",
    "    * any value expressed at the last line of a code block is considered to be the return value of that code block, that return value can be used or ignore by the programmer\n",
    "    * this applies quite generally, for example since an if statement or and if then else statement defines its true and false clauses with code blocks the if itself can return a value\n",
    "    * for example ```val result = if( 10 * 10 > 90) { \"greater\" } else { \"lesser\" }``` would created a variable with the value \"greater\"\n",
    "  * so in this case the function **inc** returns the value of **counter**\n",
    "* ```println(s\"counter created with max value $max\")``` this prints a string to the standard out.  Because the **println** is directly in the defining code block it is part of the classes initialization code and is run, i.e. prints out the string, every time an instance of this class is created.\n",
    "* The string printed in this case is an _interpolated_ string\n",
    "  * the leading **s** in front of the first double quote identifies this as an interpolated\n",
    "  * an interpolated string is processed at run time  \n",
    "  * the **$max** is replaced with the value of max\n",
    "  * if the **$** is followed by a code block arbitrary scala can be in that code block\n",
    "    * for example **${max + max}**\n",
    "    * the return value of this code block will be inserted  in place of ${...}\n",
    "    * if the return value is not a string it will be converted to one, virtually every class or type in scala has implicit conversion to a string)\n",
    "  * it should be noted that classes that print something every time an instance is created is darned annoying and should avoided\n"
