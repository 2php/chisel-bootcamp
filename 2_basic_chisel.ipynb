    "Now that you're familiar with Scala, it's time to learn Chisel. Chisel is a hardware construction language (HCL), similar to a hardware design language but embedded in a higher level, functional programming language. The details and benefits of an HCL will be covered in later modules. This module introduces basic Chisel, which is quite similar to Verilog. Once the basics are understood, you can use them to construct parameterized generators and take full advantage of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this module, the goal will be to produce a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) in hardware. If you are unfamiliar with LFSRs, skim the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) first. To do this, we will need to understand how combinational logic, sequential logic, operators, and data types are all handled in Chisel.\n",

    "### Conditional Register Updates\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conditional Combinational Updates\n",
    "Conditional blocks can also be used to generate combinational logic. Let's say now that we want a counter that counts 0, 1, 2, then resets. In this case, since we need to reset on 2, we can no longer depend on the implicit integer overflow and need to make the logic explicit:\n",
