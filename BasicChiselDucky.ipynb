    "# Conditional Logic and Wires\n",
    "_We've now seen the basics of building combinational and sequential logic circuits, but those are very low-level primitives. Chisel provides a higher level of abstraction for some operations._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Register Updates\n",
    "Chisel operators can be gated by putting them inside a `when` conditional block. In our counter example above, if we also added a `count` input signal, we could gate the incrementing of the counter as follows:\n",
    "```scala\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wires\n",
    "Conditional blocks can also be used to generate combinational logic. While we've seen the update operator `:=` used combinationally on Module boundary `IO`s, it can be also applied to Module-internal `Wire`s. Here's an example of the counter above, styled slightly differently to make the combinational logic explicit and using `Wire`s.\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val myReg = RegInit(UInt(2.W), 1.U)\n",
    "val nextReg = Wire(UInt(2.W))  // constructed similarly to Regs\n",
    "nextReg := myReg + 1.U\n",
    "myReg := nextReg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Combinational Updates\n",
    "Let's say now that we want a counter that counts 0, 1, 2, then resets. In this case, since we need to reset on 2, we can no longer depend on the implicit integer overflow and need to make the logic explicit:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val nextReg = Wire(UInt(2.W))\n",
    "when (myReg === 2.U) {\n",
    "  nextReg := 0.U\n",
    "} .otherwise {\n",
    "  nextReg := myReg + 1.U\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the example above, `when`-`otherwise` blocks behave like `if`-`else` blocks in Scala, but generate conditional hardware. `when` blocks also have an `.elsewhen (condition)`, much like `else if (condition)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that there is a `.` before the `elsewhen`, this due to limitations of Scala syntax._\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are multiple update operators that can apply at the same time, the last one takes priority. So the above example can be equivalently rewritten by unconditionally updating `nextReg` with the counter increment, then overriding it in the overflow case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val nextReg = Wire(UInt(2.W))\n",
    "nextReg := myReg + 1.U\n",
    "when (myReg === 2.U) {\n",
    "  nextReg := 0.U\n",
